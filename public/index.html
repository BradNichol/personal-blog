          <h1>Senior Backend Engineer. Pragmatic Builder. Clean Code Advocate.</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a career changer turned senior Java developer in a FTSE 100
            environment. No formal CS background. Six years of building and
            shipping features inside large enterprise systems, working across
            backend services and data-focused engineering teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            I care deeply about clean architecture, readable code, and strong
            guard rails. Slop -- human or AI -- isn't acceptable. Discipline
            still matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not a coding savant and I don't aspire to be one. I enjoy
            building useful features that fit coherently into larger systems.
            Structure, clarity, and long-term maintainability are what interest
            me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently I've been exploring agentic development and modern AI
            tooling in real production contexts. Not chasing hype. Not
            replacing engineering judgment. Using AI as an amplifier -- not a
            shortcut.
