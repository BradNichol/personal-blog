## Context Actions

Intellij is quite good at understanding the piece of code your currently writing or a piece of code that you've placed your cursor onto.

This understanding can help you with autocompletions and refactoring help. 

To use a context based action, press the option and return key together. ⌥↵. Depending on where your cursor is placed will determine what menu options are present and available.

## Find Action

If there's only one shortcut that you learn, make it this one. The find action shortcut provides a popup search box to find all of the other actions that Intellij provides. Just press command, shift, a. ⌘⇧A.

Need to commit a recent code change but you don't know the shortcut? Use the find actions shortcut and then search for commit.

## Search Everywhere

To search everything and anything within Intellij, whether it's an action, class or file etc, you can use the search everywhere tool by pressing shift ⇧ twice.

You'll notice it's the same menu that we've seen previously so should you need to filter down the results, use the various menu tabs to do this.

**TIP:** Use the prefix of the required words you're searching for. For example, if you're searching for a class called ProductServiceImp, use 'psi' to filter the results faster.
