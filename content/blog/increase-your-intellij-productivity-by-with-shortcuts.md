## Context Actions

Intellij is quite good at understanding the piece of code your currently writing or a piece of code that you've placed your cursor onto.

This understanding can help you with autocompletions and refactoring help. 

To use a context based action, press the option and return key together. ⌥↵. Depending on where your cursor is placed will determine what menu options are present and available.

## Search Actions

If there's only one shortcut that you learn, make it this one. The search actions shortcut provides a popup search box to find all of the other actions that Intellij provides. Just press command, shift, a. ⌘⇧A.

Need to commit a recent code change but you don't know the shortcut? Use the search actions shortcut and then search for commit.
