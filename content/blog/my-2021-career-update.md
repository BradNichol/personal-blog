Last May, I published a blog post about why I wanted to change careers into software development. I mainly wrote that post to see for myself the journey that I've been on, and to provide any potential employers with some context around my desire.

I wanted anyone reading it to know that changing careers into development wasn't a rash decision, but something that I had been thinking about for many years.

If you're interested, this is [my software development journey](https://www.bradleynichol.co.uk/blog/why-software-development-why-now/).

I ended the post with the following statements:

**Am I software developer yet? No!**

**Am I close? Hell yeah!**

So, did I make it? Did I achieve my goal?

### Drum roll please.....ü•Å

I am pleased to say that YES, I achieved my goal. In August last year, I officially became a software developer for Auto Trader, the UK's largest marketplace for new and used vehicles.

When I started this journey, I never thought that I would be working for such an exceptional tech-based company, especially for my first developer role, and even more so during a pandemic. My team is fantastic, and everyday I get to work with professional, senior and principal level developers. I really lucked out on this one. 

### What's next?

So now that I've achieved my multi-year goal of becoming a developer, what's next? Well, this is just the start of my new journey. My focus now is on developing my career, pushing myself and learning more. 

I have started my [digital garden](https://brain.bradleynichol.co.uk/) (a personal knowledge wiki) to document what I'm learning, and I will be extending this blog with some technical posts aimed to solidify my knowledge and to also help others new to software development.

Thanks for reading.
