title: The 80/20 Rule For Learning Java
description: 80/20 rule for Java
category: ["Java Development"]
---
This post is inspired by my last 12 months as a professional Java developer, after previously transistioning from a completely different career.

Since becoming a developer, my personal development roadmap has been focussed on learning Java to become productive within my team. 

Part of my learning has involved using a Beginners Guide to Java book, which although great, covers a lot of information and language usages that I've not encounted within the current Enterprise level codebases that I've been working on.

So, I hope this short post covers what I believe are the most used parts of the Java language that are enough for you to become productive.
