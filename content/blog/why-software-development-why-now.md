## **Early Years**

13… that’s how old I was when we got our first family computer. A Windows 98 machine, which came with a massive 12gb of storage, 1g of RAM, a CD-ROM and a floppy drive.

Using computers was quite natural for me as I had used them in school, and I seemed to have a general aptitude for operating them, but not so much for my parents. So, the tasks of setting it up was left to me.

Ever since then, I’ve always often been asked by friends, family or work colleagues for tech help. I never really considered myself someone who was good at using technology as it just came naturally to me. I enjoyed coming up against issues and trying to figure out a way to solve them.

After figuring out how to ‘surf’ the internet on our first computer I was hooked by what it offered, and it didn’t take long for my inquisitiveness to learn how websites were made.

Back then, after searching and clicking around AOL and Altasvita for many hours, I pulled enough info together to create basic websites myself using good old Notepad.

I can still remember how they looked: classic 3-panel layout; left nav, header and central content with a scroll bar.

I was not aware of CSS as it had just launched, so styling was provided directly in HTML and the layouts were developed using HTML tables and frames. The golden age!

Surely this early passion would become my career path...

## **Now**

Fast forward 18 years and here I am, finally pursuing a career change to become a Software Developer.

*So, why now?*

After leaving University, I’ve been on a career journey that has kept itself as close as possible to technology.

During my time running a business, I learnt a lot about SEO (search engine optimisation) and other online marketing skills. I found that online marketing allowed me to continue working on websites, growing them and testing out new ideas quickly.

I further developed my skills in this area and obtained a Diploma in Digital Marketing.

Over the years I had worked on two large eCommerce projects for my employers at the time. Both times I had project managed these from start to finish, developing the specifications and hiring development agencies.

I always loved digging into the code and discussing ideas, features and improvements with the developers, all the while being enamoured by what they could do.

After the web projects were finished, it was up to me to continue growing them. Whenever there was an opportunity to make a change or install a new plugin, I jumped in with both feet and did it myself.

Hours could go by while I was trying to understand a piece of code, and once I figured it out, it felt amazing!

I often looked into pursuing a career in software/web in my early-to-mid twenties, but I held myself back from limiting beliefs. These beliefs included the requirement of a degree in development or that I needed to be great at mathematics.

A few more years went by and I was steadily growing my career in digital marketing, along with my income when the thought of changing careers became more distant thinking. This was even more so after proposing and buying a house. I probably wouldn’t be married now if I’d spent all of my time re-training back then, and I wasn’t in the position to potentially move careers and take a pay cut.

A year after being married, my mind started to wander again about the prospect of moving into a career path that I’ve always wanted to do.

The fact that I’ve only been working for a decade and that I’ve still got another 4 decades of work ahead of me made me realise that I need to focus on a career that will constantly challenge me.

Now was the perfect window of opportunity.

I decided to stop deliberating and start learning!

This was December 2018. My initial plan was to find some online courses and stick with it. I told my wife and myself, that If I was still coding daily after 4 months, I knew this just wasn’t a momentary phase and that it was what I truly wanted.

1 year and 5 months (May 2020) later, I’m still here, coding away on the Gatsby blog that I’ve built.

**Am I software developer yet? No!**

**Am I close? Hell yeah!**
