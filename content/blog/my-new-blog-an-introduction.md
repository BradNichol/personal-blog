Hi,

Welcome to my new blog, built on the Gatsby framework.

My name is Brad, and I'm currently training to become a software developer. 

This blog serves as my own little place on the net to gather my thoughts and share what I'm learning about software development. 

I'm the primary audience, and will use this blog to look back and see how far I've come, and hopefully some of my articles will help other beginners too.

That's it for now, thanks for stopping bye and if you notice any problems with this site, my code or knowledge, please let me know. Feedback is more than welcome.



Thanks,

Brad
