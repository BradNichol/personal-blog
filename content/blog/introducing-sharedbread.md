This is the first time that I will have mentioned Tech Returners on this blog. TR is a bootcamp course that I'm currently attending and I'll be talking all about the great experience that I have had with them in upcoming blogs.

For this blog, I wanted to show you what my team and I have achieved in just over a week and half of development, whilst also working full-time.

Introducing Sharedbread, a mobile-first food bank app designed to show users what food banks need in their local areas, and to encourage users to donate more.

The presentation in the video below was created to showcase our skills and product during our final presentation evening.

Live app can be seen here: <https://www.sharedbread.app/>
