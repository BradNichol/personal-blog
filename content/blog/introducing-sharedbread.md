This is the first time that I will have mentioned Tech Returners on this blog. TR is a bootcamp course that I'm currently attending and I'll be talking all about the great experience that I have had with them in upcoming blogs.\
\
But for this blog, I want to show you the what my team and I have achieved in just over a week and half, whilst also working full-time.

Introducing Sharedbread, a mobile-first food bank app designed to show users what food banks need in their local areas, and to encourage users to donate more.

Live app can be seen here: <https://www.sharedbread.app/>
