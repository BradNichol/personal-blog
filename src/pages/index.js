        <h1>Hi, I'm Bradley Nichol</h1>
        
        <p>I'm a software developer based in Leyland, Lancashire,
          working for a FTSE100 company in the automotive industry. I predominately
          work on backend systems using Java, with careera sprinkle of Angular frontend work for 
          internal tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my past life I was a digital marketing professional for many years, and after 
          two years of self-development I successfully transitioned into a software
          development. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm sharing my thoughts, journey and what I'm learning here. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for stopping by.
